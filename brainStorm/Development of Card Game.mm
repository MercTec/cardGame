<node CREATED="1438383796398" ID="ID_213946674" MODIFIED="1438385960127" TEXT="And it is exactly as they say it is. They rely hugely on gimmicks and side show effects to create a mirage barrage of &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; that trick you into thinking you are about to have fun. They encapsulate every element of a card game in a very small space with good graphics but they don&apos;t have enough cards. There isn&apos;t enough cards in their collection or in the deck itself. So the strategy is greatly limited to the class you are in, where the game becomes more of a game like rock papers scissors - &quot;Oh I hope I don&apos;t run into a paladin&quot; because paladin beats shaman: rock beats scissors. That&apos;s not fun. That&apos;s not complex enough. However the stage is simple and it DOES have complexity. The entire thing with the coin toss giving the second player one extra mana crystal in one turn as a zero cost spell card is ingenious to say the least. It balances the advantage the first player has over the second nicely and is the number one thing going for it. It makes the game every time. However, the first player gets only 3 cards while the second player gets 4. This is (for their game) another balancing act and is a good idea but 3 cards is just too small at all for a starting hand. They again, are just too small in everything and it kills it. They are relying on size to be their measure of simplicity but I can make a card game with 10,000 cards and make it very simple. Chess is not simple yet it is small. So complexity and size are two different things and they have the bad mix of it. Our goal is to get the right blend as we would expect a battle to be. So our natural experience should guide us as we search for that back and forth epic battle that can only be sustained in complete fairness. Each player has to have complete equality like chess to determine the true champion but each player has to be completely unique like WoW to suit the differences of people and make a long lasting gaming experience. Consider the bicycle deck of cards. 52 cards of such a fully square design and I&apos;m not talking about the card itself but the uniquely defining characteristics of each card. There is no card that is the same as another and yet there are 26 common cards and 13 common cards and 4 common cards and 4 common cards and 1 unique set of 4 common cards upon the basis of the 5 attributes which define them: color and suit and value and face and ace. So many games can be played where you isolate certain attributes for certain rules with only 52 possibilities - each unique yet wholly tied together through it&apos;s symmetries. Yes many different games can be made but alas they are all held and bound to a single fate - whoever draws the hand wins the game. The relative symmetries are usually not taken advantage of in most games and they usually determine the winner solely on the basis of the order in which your cards sit in the deck - as if the game is just playing itself and you aren&apos;t really making much decision as to the outcome. We can and should all agree that the measure and greatness of a game is the measure to which the player determines the outcome through his choice of playing one card over another, rather than the shuffling of the deck. This understanding is what drove us to make more creative card games like Pokemon and Magic where there are dubious amounts of unique cards in which the player himself may create his own deck and thereby create his own set of symmetries with respect to the object of the game, thereby allowing the shuffling of the deck to be covered over by a preemptive motion from the player. Nevertheless, this only goes so far since the relative powers of the cards available determine the choices the player will make much more than he would if they were all the same as in the case of the bicycle deck. Thus we may return to much of the same result as the bicycle deck which we clearly see is happening right in front of our eyes with Hearthstone - so much promise yet just doesn&apos;t cut the mustard. We want to get it right. We want to make a card game that is sitting right in the middle: both of chess and WoW with a severe emphasis on the ability of the player to train his deck into a stronger one without necessarily having the rarer, better cards that decimate everything in it&apos;s path. We want to give the little card a chance to make an impact, rather than just be a stepping stone to garner greater cards. We want the whole thing to be necessary, where it is in the player&apos;s ability to encapsulate the whole to determine a winner, rather than just collecting better cards and winning therefore. We want the beginning cards to be no better or worse but that all the cards are necessary to complete the perfect strategy.">

<node CREATED="1438391739636" ID="ID_1248352672" MODIFIED="1438393624482" TEXT="I wanted to expound upon the relationship I spoke of between choice and fate. If fate was such a problem then why not get rid of it entirely? Imagine having a 70 card deck with all your cards shuffled. Then imagine having a 70 card hand, the shuffling doesn&apos;t matter at all at that point. We could easily make our game to be that way, where you literally have your entire army at your disposal right from the start. Now do you see what I&apos;m talking about in terms of the problem of Hearthstone? With Hearthstone cards you would never want to play the weak cards since that would be stupid at that point. All your best cards would get played and then it would be a strong man&apos;s competition to see who had the best Legendary dragon. No strategy there at all. I want our card game to be capable of sustaining such a thing much more, even to 100% capacity just as having a 70 card hand would be. Do you see what I&apos;m saying? If you had everything at your disposal, everything would still need to be used to win your battle. But why is that a terrible idea in practice? People generally don&apos;t like or can&apos;t bear to have that responsibility all at once. They need to form a plan one piece at a time. Thus drawing a card at a time is a more sensible pace for most strategists since the whole thing is always overwhelming. Also, that takes the fun out of it too. When we have complete control of our destiny and we see our latter end, whether it be defeat or glory, we despair of it. By allowing random chance to make half our decisions for us we allow ourselves to make the rest in peace. And that&apos;s exactly what I want. We must procure a game which leaves exactly 50% decision of the outcome to the shuffling of the deck and 50% of the outcome to the player who chooses this card over that card. And since I have already established Quick Match with 40 cards and Tournament with 70 then we will have to do some statistical analysis to determine what hand size would give that possibiilty with respect to the individual abilities of the cards themselves. For the balance of the cards themselves with respect to each other will determine the coefficient of &quot;friction&quot; that the hand size gets for determining a 50/50 shot. So to keep things simple if they were all the same cards you would have a 50/50 shot for 70 card deck with a 35 card hand. But that is still too large of a hand so there obviously needs to be an imbalance in the abilities of the cards. We would set the gradient exponential or linear or even the golden ratio from the weakest to the greatest cards. Then with respect to their power we would set their relative availability to the player to match and this should allow for a smaller hand size. How much smaller of a hand size can we go? It all depends on the slope that we set for the power growth of a card&apos;s collection. Maybe you don&apos;t follow me that far...I&apos;m trying to piece it together myself. Instead imagine 69 cards that are all blank and one legendary behemoth. If you were battling your opponent who had 69 blank cards and 1 legendary dragon then at that point you can see it. A 35 card hand would give each of you a 50/50 shot at drawing the legendary beast and so win the game (by Hearthstone standards). So obviously there must be a tipping of the equality in terms of the cards or else there would be no different of a battle if there were 70 1/1 peons or 70 10/10 legendaries. So the tipping of that power scale through the 70 card deck will then leave you wth a 50/50 shot in truth. So I hope you can see that now. ">

<node CREATED="1438394706256" ID="ID_813272301" MODIFIED="1438396183246" TEXT="So I mean to say that a 50/50 shot is the absolute BEST that a player could hope for. Where, if a player had collected every single card in his collection and was about to make a deck, then the ultimate strategy that he could ever make would still leave him at 50/50 to the shuffling of the deck. A poor strategist only renders up his will to the power of chance. So if he chose worse, then his deck would be rated at 30/70 let&apos;s say. Here, he is taking a 70% percent chance that he will lose and a 30% chance he will win given that his opponent has the same choice of a deck. If he was facing a 50/50 while he was at a 30/70 and both played 100% savvy then his chances of winning are...shoot that is not an SAT question for sure. Still working on it. Let&apos;s look at it like this: 35 legendary behemoths and 35 blank cards. First player has a 50/50 shot at winning. Where second player has 21 legendary behemoths and 49 blank cards. So...then second player has 30% of 50% chance of winning if hand size was still 35. I could be wrong. My math is generally terrible. So a 15% chance of winning? Man I gotta finish school. And...first player has a 65% chance of winning and that means that there is 20% chance they will tie? That would be amazing if it actually worked that way. I could seriously make a console application in C# that generates these games over and over again and gives us statistics but the only problem is that I need to find a random number algorithm that is true. Random numbers don&apos;t actually exist. You have to get a uniquely generated key that is called the &quot;salt&quot; which is then matricied out into a more complex figure probably through fractal mathematics or something. So the salt is usually just a time stamp; a numerical representation of the world time. But since that is just an increasing value the randomness is always curbed. Even the default random number generator in C# compiler just uses the run time as the seed/salt/key and it is no where near random. It generates tons of the same numbers depending on what line of code your random number generator is on. Yeah that stinks. So this leads to a next point I wanted to make about this game.">

So this whole universe is a physical construct and thus it houses enough possibilities to hide the future. But within a computer game it is such a smaller construct that you can literally get a feel for where the computer is going to take it - even with dice rolls. Like I began to explain in the last addendum, randomness must be constructed by the computer with a unique key. Seismograph like machines or radio antennas can be used to pick up frequencies in space or in the earth which will be &quot;random&quot; to our minds and we can use that data as a key to apply fractal mathematics to it and thus create a truly unique key from it. The fractal mathematics or algorithms are just to scramble the key out even further and even give it a physical representation like numbers and letters. &quot;Give A for 08234098, Give 9 for 204830, Give [ for...&quot; Blah blah down on forever it seems. Now this is all very important because I believe in chance. It is my ally. I hate playing computer games because they cheat. But I&apos;ll roll the dice all day and have fun whether it be Risk or Monopoly. So I want to figure out how to truly have a sufficiently random number generator so that it does my God proud. You must understand. There is such a thing as statistical shinanagery and I believe Blizzard does it. I know they increase the odds for paying players to get good cards and they decrease the odds for non-paying players. Because it&apos;s all about the money. They want the paying players to be happy. They want the non-paying players to be frustrated. What better way than to stop them right in their tracks by playing God. And why shouldn&apos;t they? It&apos;s THEIR game isn&apos;t it? They made it. But you see? They made it for themselves and so they cheat the dice thinking they are intelligent but I know that the only way to do it is to leave it completely up to chance, since that is God&apos;s way. He has complete faith it will all work out. Which is pretty crazy if you think about it. Now all this is to say that we will advertise this very thing as a sale point. You will know that the computers don&apos;t cheat. That we use one and only one algorithm for our random keys and EVERYONE has a completely fair chance at getting any card. You see? When you open a pack you really feel the wonder of the possibility of getting something truly great. That is what we cannot destroy in our game. We must maintain the integrity of randomness. Now let&apos;s say with respect to the power growth curve of a collection of cards we made their availability the same. So a 1% power card has a 99% chance availability and a 99% card has a 1% chance. So that is just making one thing rare and another common but it is ALWAYS that way. Those availabilities never change and they aren&apos;t stacked. Like WoW, they give a linear power growth curve but an exponential chance curve. So you are always growing in power linearly but it takes you an exponential amount of effort just to do that. Now I hate that. We either go linear for linear or exponential for exponential or golden ratio for golden ratio. Which my choice is the golden ratio since I believe it to be fundamentally fair. It&apos;s still exponential but it&apos;s just less so and it is proportional in terms of all the universe. But all this has gone a little too far. But maybe you like the conversation. The point is, it&apos;s going to be a part of the vision that we create a truly honest and fair chance for people to get truly great cards.">

<node CREATED="1438397754953" ID="ID_1088366770" MODIFIED="1438397894866" TEXT="The answer was already stated. As long as we maintain the integrity of randomness we can trust that no one will be getting legendary or epic like cards out of hand and that no one will be &quot;overpowered&quot; for no reason. Someone will legitimately have a legendary card and it will truly be a rare thing. But you will have just the same chance to get one. So we DO make great cards. We DO make weak cards but everyone has the same chance in getting them: paid or not.">
<node CREATED="1438397954060" ID="ID_1968738360" MODIFIED="1438398817337" TEXT="So I hope this is the last statement about randomness but one other factor must be considered in our randomness growth curve. And that is the general time spent by players to get cards, with respect to how many cards they actually get. Why is this ratio important and how does it affect the playability of our game? It is for two reasons: one we want the players to actually get rare cards - but what if, with respect to their devotion it is relatively easy to get them? The statistical Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of trials in a period increases the actual outcomes balance out to the literal odds. And it further states that on a practical level the magic number is 10,000 trials of any singe event of chance will leave you with the exact number of outcomes. Thus if you flip a coin 10,000 times you will literally have 5,000 heads and 5,000 tails give or take so much a small percentage. If you roll a 10 sided dice 10,000 times then you will literally get 1,000 ones, 1,000 twos, 1,000 threes and so on. Can you believe that? Yes, nothing is really random. What happens is that an event is given it&apos;s chance and that that is shared evenly amongst them all in time. One just has to have enough time to see the fairness of life. So don&apos;t let anyone ever tell you life isn&apos;t fair. Oh it&apos;s fair alright. We men are the ones who like to tip the scales in our favor any chance we can get, rather than let them fall as they lie. And this is a vanity, a striving after the wind. So the ACTUAL odds of getting a rare or legendary can be changed from time to time to stop this event from happening because if a player simply spends enough time then they WILL 100% get a rare card sooner or later. This is what WoW does to keep you playing forever. They tip the scales and I can feel it all the time. It is not fair. But it&apos;s not to say that this phenomenon doesn&apos;t happen in real life either. There are certain spots on the earth where the ley lines of the gravitational fields of the earth are stronger and it is said that in those places randomness drops. There have been studies of random number generators all across the world with the same algorithm that will produce statistically different randomness in not only different parts of the world but at different TIMES. That&apos;s right, when the stars align they say and they don&apos;t say it for no reason, when the stars align the energies of them are magnified on the earth and this further reduces those randomness swells. Pretty amazing right? It is absolutely fantastic. It is the work of God."/>
